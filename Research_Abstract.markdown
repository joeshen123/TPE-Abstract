Neutrophil recruitment is the hallmark of innate immune response during tissue
damage and infection. Neutrophils can be guided toward the target region by
various chemoattractants such as cytokines IL-8. In addition to cytokines,
a class of inflammatory signaling lipid molecules called Eicosanoids can
recruit neutrophils to the target region. Eicosinoids are synthesized through
a series of oxidative pathways from arachidonic acids (AA), which is released
from membrane phospholipids by phospholipases especially cytosolic
phospholipases 2 (Cpla2). Our lab has previously demonstrated biomechanical
induced membrane tension serves as a regulator of cpla2 and eicosinoid
synthesis pathway, which leads to neutrophil recruitment towards inflammatory
region in zebrafish. Our research has indicated both the presence of calcium
ions and membrane stretch are required for cpla2 recruitment to nuclear
membrane. But the detailed mechanism of cpla2 membrane recruitment is poorly
understood. We decide to use a reductionist and bottom-up approach to
investigate this question. In particular, we incubate purified proteins and
artificially reconstituted Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) and utilize time
lapse live imaging to observe the binding of purified proteins on GUVs over
time. Then we compare the binding profiles of wt Cpla2, mutant Cpla2 and other
membrane binding proteins to understand the mechanism of Cpla2 protein. In
addition, my research is also going to investigate the detailed mechanism of
how mechano-sensing cpla2 pathway playing a role in neutrophil recruitment to
sites of tissue damage. We hypothesize that in addition to signals secreted by
damaged cells neutrophils can also secrete eicosinoids through membrane
tension-mediated cpla2 pathway, which leads to a postive feedback loop to
amplify the signals and recruit more neutrophils to infection sites. In order
to test this hypothesis, we will design microfluidic cell chamber and apply
cellular confinements on neutrophils and test whether this will increase
recruitments of other neutrophils.
