Thesis Title: Investigate the Nuclear Membrane Biomechanical Control of Neutrophils Recruitment during Inflammation

Neutrophil recruitment is the hallmark of innate immune response during tissue
damage and infection. Neutrophils can be guided toward the target region by
a broad range of chemoattractants including bacterial products, tissue derived
cytokines and leukocyte-released lipid mediators. Tissue and cell swelling is
a common state preceding necrosis during tissue damage. Previously, our lab has
demonstrated that osmotic-induced cell swelling regulates neutrophils guidance
through nuclear membrane tension-induced recruitment of cytosolic phospholipase
(cpla2), which initiates the production and secretion of inflammatory lipid
mediators (Eicosinoid acids). But the molecular details that defines cpla2 as
a nuclear membrane tension sensor is poorly understood. In order to investigate
this question, we simplify our system by incubating cpla2 and other related
enzymes with artificially reconstituted lipid bilayers in hypotonic solutions
and compare their binding profiles. In addition, my research is also going to
revisit the physiological relationships between stretch-induced cpla2
activation and neutrophil recruitment. Aside from tissue damage-induced osmotic
cell swelling, leukocytes extravasation and migration through confined
extracellular space lead to increase of  membrane tension. Therefore, We
hypothesize that in addition to the signals provided by osmotically swelling
damage cells, neutrophils can also recruit other neutrophils through
stretch-induced cpla2 activation, which creates a positive-feedback loop. In
order to test this hypothesis, we will design microfluidic cell chamber and
apply cellular confinements on neutrophils and test whether this will increase
recruitments of other neutrophils. Ultimately, we will use intravital imaging
in zebrafish model to examine the in vivo relevance of insights gained from
artificial liposomes and cell culture models. Through the integration of
multilevel approaches, our work will demonstrate nuclear membrane
mechano-sensing can mediate innate immune response and leukocytes recruitment
during conditions of tissue damage and infections.
